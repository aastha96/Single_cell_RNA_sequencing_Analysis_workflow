#scRNA-seq Data Analysis
This is my first project on single-cell RNA sequencing data. Using the Seurat Vignettes workflow for initial preprocessing, I also attempted to remove batch effect using Harmony.
I explored the Myeloid dataset from A Single-Cell and Spatially-Resolved Atlas of Human Breast Cancers (CellxGene Link) in this project. This project involved rigorous computational techniques to uncover cellular heterogeneity and disease-specific patterns.
Key Highlights of My Analysis:

âœ… Quality Control & Normalization â€“ Ensured data integrity by filtering low-quality cells based on RNA feature counts and mitochondrial gene content.

 âœ… Dimensionality Reduction â€“ Leveraged PCA & UMAP to effectively visualize high-dimensional data.

 âœ… Clustering & Cell Identification â€“ Used Seurat to define distinct cellular subpopulations.

 âœ… Batch Effect Correction â€“ Implemented Harmony to eliminate technical noise and enhance biological signal clarity.

 âœ… Data Visualization â€“ Explored cell clusters, disease states, and cell types to reveal meaningful biological insights.

Technical Stack & Tools:

ðŸ›  R Libraries â€“ Seurat, Harmony, ggplot2, patchwork, and more.

 ðŸ“Š Data Preprocessing â€“ Feature normalization, variable feature selection, and scaling.

 ðŸŽ¨ Advanced Visualization â€“ Generated clear and interpretable UMAP plots to capture cellular diversity.
